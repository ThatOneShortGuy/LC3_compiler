# With this compiler, will come a custom language as well.
We are still deciding how we want this language to work, and are open to suggestions.
The end goal is to make it for the LC-3.
Pehaps, we may even make it work for other systems as well.
Some considered language options:
- Typdef (like in C)
- Functional
- Easy to write (like python)
1. Both `;` and `\n` as statement separators
2. Both `\t` and `{...}` as block separators

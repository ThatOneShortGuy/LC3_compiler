# With this compiler, will come a custom language as well.
We are still deciding how we want this language to work, and are open to suggestions.
Some considered language options:
- typdef (like in C)
- functional
- easy to write (like python)
- 1. both `;` and `\n` as statement separators
- 2. both `\t` and `{...}` as block separators
